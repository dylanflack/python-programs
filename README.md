# Python-Programs
-- python 3.12
This is a collection of small python programs that I've worked on
and currently working on

> [!NOTE] 
> Active_Processes
>Creates text Document that shows active processes running on your
system sorts them by how much ram they are utilizing, displays
the same information to the terminal shows duplicate processes in 
red

> Algorithms_python
>demonstrates how fast some popular sorting algorithms are in 
python

> Quiz_Template 
It's a Quiz template using a JSON file to store the questions

> User_Forms
> An old outdated version of USER_FORMS_V2 one of my more larger
and ambitious projects early on, it's bloated and filled with
unnecssary and unconventional optimizations and data that's 
not important for the user. My goal for this program was to step
outside my comfort zone using classes and different types
of modules and libraries 

> User_Forms_v2
> User_Forms but not filled with uncescssary bloat 
> [Work in progess]
